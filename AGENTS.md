# Ito Instructions

These instructions are for AI assistants working in this project.

Always open `@/.ito/AGENTS.md` when the request:

- Mentions planning or proposals (words like proposal, spec, change, plan)
- Introduces new capabilities, breaking changes, architecture shifts, or big performance/security work
- Sounds ambiguous and you need the authoritative spec before coding

Use `@/.ito/AGENTS.md` to learn:

- How to create and apply change proposals
- Spec format and conventions
- Project structure and guidelines

Note: Files under `.ito/`, `.opencode/`, `.github/`, and `.codex/` are installed/updated by Ito (`ito init`, `ito update`) and may be overwritten.
Add project-specific guidance in `.ito/user-prompts/guidance.md` (shared), `.ito/user-prompts/<artifact>.md` (artifact-specific), and/or below this managed block.

Keep this managed block so 'ito update' can refresh the instructions.

## Path Helpers

Use `ito path ...` to get absolute paths at runtime (do not hardcode absolute paths into committed files):

- `ito path project-root`
- `ito path worktree-root`
- `ito path ito-root`
- `ito path worktrees-root`
- `ito path worktree --main|--branch <name>|--change <id>`

## Worktree Workflow


Worktrees are not configured for this project.

- Do NOT create git worktrees by default.
- Work in the current checkout unless the user explicitly requests a worktree workflow.

## Project Guidance

(Add any project-specific assistant guidance here. Prefer `.ito/user-prompts/guidance.md` for shared instruction guidance and `.ito/user-prompts/<artifact>.md` for phase-specific guidance.)
