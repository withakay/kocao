### Requirement: Desktop-like interactions are consistent across workflow UI

Run/session workflow pages and attach flow SHALL use consistent desktop-like interaction patterns including collapsible sections, slide-in inspector surfaces, and keyboard-discoverable layout actions.

#### Scenario: User inspects workflow data without leaving context

- **WHEN** a user is operating from the attach flow and needs metadata context
- **THEN** metadata can be inspected in-panel without leaving the terminal route
